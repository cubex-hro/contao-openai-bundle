# Contao OpenAI Bundle

The purpose of this extension is to quickly and easily generate meta descriptions and titles from page content using ChatGPT (OpenAI).

Below we have summarized a few best practices to achieve relatively good results.
Additional features are planned in the future that will make the expansion even better.

## Getting started

composer require cubex-hro/contao-openai-bundle
